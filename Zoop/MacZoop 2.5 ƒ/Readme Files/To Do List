MacZoop 2.5 To Do List:This is a list of known issues that didn't make it into the 2.5 final release. They will be addressed in due course.* Drag and Drop in lists - drag to self not correctly working yet* Themes with patterned list backgrounds don't hilite correctly in ZArrayBrowser - for now, you need to avoid such themes. Official themes (Platinum & Aqua) are fine.* Themes that place the focus ring inside the border don't look right in some cases. Again, avoid these themes, but in the long run this will probably be made to work.* File Browser header needs to scroll with the browser itself.* Changes as needed to VIEW resource support to actually work - currently the code is a placeholder for what will be there when VIZ is working.
