Full Terms and Conditions of Use, February 2001These terms and conditions supercede any and all previously published terms and conditions.Plain english explanations are given in italic and do not constitute part of the terms and conditions.1. You may download the MacZoop SDK including source code free of charge, but may only use it strictly in accordance with these terms and conditions. Your right to use MacZoop is granted only provided all terms and conditions are fully met.2. The MacZoop source code, SDK, documentation, etc may not be redistributed in any form, modified or otherwise, except as a "derivative work" in the form of executeable code. A derivative work is one including any part of the MacZoop code, no matter how small, and even if modified from its original form.3. MacZoop may be used to create derivative works for any purpose, and with any license, including, but not restricted to: commercial, shareware, freeware, in-house.4. The MacZoop source code may be modified as necessary for your private use, but may not be redistributed in this or any form except according to (2) above. If you want changes to be permanently made, you may request that they be incorporated in a subsequent release.5. If you distribute source code to your MacZoop-derived application, it should not directly include code from MacZoop. Instead, you should include a reference to the MacZoop website where MacZoop may be obtained directly. If your code requires a change to MacZoop that is not part of an official version, you may additionally distribute those changed parts as necessary to allow the code to be used.These rules are intended to prevent the proliferation of unofficial versions of MacZoop, which I do not have the resources to maintain or support. As far as possible you should avoid depending on a specific MacZoop version.6. The MacZoop source code, associated code and documentation remain the copyright of the author, Graham Cox.7. The following minimum copyright notice must appear clearly in the "about box" of any derived work of MacZoop, and additionally in any accompanying documentation:"Created with the MacZoop framework, ©1994-2001 Graham Cox. All Rights Reserved"8. The documentation should also additionally include the URL for the MacZoop website : http://www.maczoop.com The about box may do so, but is not required to. About boxes nor documentation are not required to contain this notice exclusively.9. If your derived application does not have an about box, nor any specific documentation, you should distribute an additional read me file called "Copyright Notice" which includes the copyright notice and the URL as in (7) and (8) above.The purpose of these rules is to give credit where it's due and hopefully to spread awareness of the use of MacZoop.10. The author, Graham Cox, cannot be held liable for any damage or other mishap arising out of the use of, or inability to use MacZoop. Additionally, the fitness of MacZoop for any purpose is not warranted.You use it at your own risk and if it doesn't do what you want it to, I'm not legally responsible.11. Provided derivative works comply with these terms and conditions, I hereby relinquish any claim to ownership, authorship, rights or responsibilities in respect of such works.In other words, if you build an application that makes you a millionaire, you don't owe me a penny, but similarly if your application causes nuclear meltdown, they can't touch me for it.Graham CoxFebruary, 2001
